# Solution Summary: Reducing .git Directory Size

## Problem Statement
The `.git` directory was 52MB, causing slow clone times. Users reported that cloning the repository takes a long time.

## Root Cause Analysis
Investigation revealed that large binary files were being tracked in Git:
- Seismic data files (`.sgy`): ~44 MB total
- Image files (`.png`): ~13 MB total  
- Video files (`.avi`): ~3 MB total
- Other binaries (`.pkl`, `.asc`, `.pdf`): ~6 MB total

These files should not be in version control as they are:
1. Binary files that don't benefit from version control
2. Example/test data that can be provided separately
3. Large enough to significantly slow down clone operations

## Solution Implemented

### Immediate Changes (Completed)
1. **Updated `.gitignore`** to prevent future commits of large binary files
   - Added patterns for seismic data formats, images, videos, and other binaries
   - Files: `.sgy`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.avi`, `.mp4`, `.pkl`, `.asc`, `.pdf`, etc.

2. **Removed 20 large files from Git tracking**
   - Used `git rm --cached` to stop tracking without deleting local files
   - Total size removed from future commits: ~52 MB

3. **Created comprehensive documentation**:
   - `deltaseis/data/README.md` - How to obtain data files
   - `CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Guide for maintainers to clean Git history
   - Updated main `README.md` - Added "Data Files" section
   - Updated tutorials - Added notes about data file requirements

### Future Actions (For Repository Maintainers)

The files are removed from tracking but **still exist in Git history**. To complete the cleanup:

1. **Clean Git history** using the instructions in `CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - Use `git-filter-repo` or BFG Repo-Cleaner
   - This will reduce `.git` from 52MB to < 5MB
   - **Warning**: This rewrites history - all contributors must re-clone

2. **Provide data files separately**:
   - Upload example data as GitHub release assets
   - Document download instructions
   - Consider using Git LFS for essential large files

3. **Set up branch protection**:
   - Add pre-commit hooks to prevent large file commits
   - Use CI checks to verify file sizes

## Impact

### For New Users (After history cleanup)
- ✅ Clone time reduced by ~90% (52MB → <5MB)
- ✅ Faster `git pull` and `git fetch` operations
- ✅ Reduced storage requirements
- ⚠️ Must obtain data files separately (documented)

### For Existing Users
- ✅ No immediate impact - files remain in working directory
- ⚠️ After maintainer cleans history, must re-clone repository
- ✅ Clear documentation on how to proceed

## Verification

Before history cleanup:
```bash
$ du -sh .git
52M     .git

$ git count-objects -vH
size-pack: 51.41 MiB
```

After changes (but before history cleanup):
- New clones will not download large binary files
- Future commits won't include large files (protected by `.gitignore`)
- Documentation guides users on obtaining data files

Expected after history cleanup:
```bash
$ du -sh .git
<5M     .git
```

## Files Affected

### Removed from tracking (20 files):
- `deltaseis/data/*.sgy` (8 files)
- `deltaseis/data/*.png` (4 files)
- `examples/*.avi` (3 files)
- `deltaseis/data/*.pkl` (1 file)
- `deltaseis/data/*.asc` (1 file)
- `deltaseis/processing/*.pdf` (1 file)

### Still tracked (small files only):
- Text files (`.txt`, `.xml`)
- Source code (`.py`)
- Documentation (`.md`)
- Configuration files

## Recommendations

1. **For immediate relief**: Merge this PR to prevent new large files from being committed
2. **For complete solution**: Follow `CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to clean history
3. **For long-term**: Consider Git LFS for any essential large files
4. **For users**: Update documentation/releases with data file downloads
